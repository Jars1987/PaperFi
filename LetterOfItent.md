# Project Overview

## Capstone Project Name/Idea:

PaperFi - Research Paper Finance.

## Brief Project Description:

PaperFi is a decentralized platform designed to revolutionize academic
publishing by providing a marketplace where researchers can publish and monetize
their work without reliance on traditional journals. The papers are published
on-chain ensuring transparency, secure access through encryption, and
decentralized storage. Researchers earn revenue directly from paper sales, and
NFT-based achievement badges incentivize active participation and high-quality
contributions.

## Reason for Choosing this Project:

PaperFi addresses critical issues in academic publishing, such as monopolization
by centralized journals that impose high access costs and restrict researchers'
control over their work. As a pharmacist and blockchain enthusiast, I aim to
apply the principles of decentralization to make scientific knowledge more
accessible and empower researchers worldwide.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Target Audience:

The main target are the researchers and academics by serving them with an
alternative to publishing. Attached to researchers we will have universities,
research institutions, libraries, and independent learners interested in
accessing cutting-edge research. Academics are more prone to be onboarded to a
blockchain like Solana.

### Value Proposition:

Ownership: Researchers retain full ownership and control over their work.
Affordability: The platform reduces costs for both researchers and buyers.
Transparency: Decentralized and secure access ensures fair and open
dissemination of knowledge.

### Marketing and Distribution:

Community Building: Engage with researchers, academics, and institutions to
foster a collaborative scientific community. Collaborations: Partner with
universities, DeSci communities, and blockchain organizations to enhance
credibility and reach. Conferences and Webinars: Participate in academic and
blockchain events to showcase PaperFi and onboard users.

## Competitive Landscape

### Competitors:

ResearchHub and traditional academic publishers.

### Differentiators:

- PDA-based on-chain storage for paper metadata (no limitations on sales).
- Secure, one-time-use decryption mechanisms for paper access.
- Peer review functionality with public reviews visible on paper pages.
- No APC (Article Processing Charges).
- Achievement badges as NFTs to incentivize contributions.
- Revenue from direct sales without secondary market dependency.
- Researchers can pay other renowned researchers or freelancers to review
  research
- Teams can hire researchers to do particular research
- Weekly Newsletter with Research/community updates

### Technical Details

## Tech Stack:

- Blockchain Platform: Solana.
- Smart Contract Development: Rust (Anchor framework).
- Frontend: Next.js.
- Backend: Node.js.
- Storage: IPFS or Arweave for decentralized file storage, combined with
  encryption for secure access.
- Encryption: AES with Crypto-JS or similar plus ZK frameworks.

### Smart Contract Development:

- Programming Language: Anchor framework (Rust) for robust and secure smart
  contracts.
- Testing: Comprehensive unit and integration testing to ensure reliability.
- Audits: Fuzzing and third-party audits to enhance security.

## Conclusion

Project Timeline: MVP Development: 4-6 weeks for marketplace and PDA
implementation. Encryption and Storage: Additional 2-3 weeks for integrating
secure access features. Frontend and Backend Enhancements: Continuous iterations
based on user feedback.

Commitment: I am dedicated to contributing to Solana by delivering an innovative
platform that transforms academic publishing and promotes decentralization in
science. Initials: JS
