# PaperFi

# Project Overview

## Capstone Project Name/Idea:

PaperFi - Research Paper Finance.

## Brief Project Description:

PaperFi is a decentralized platform designed to revolutionize academic
publishing by providing a marketplace where researchers can publish and monetize
their work without reliance on traditional journals. The papers are published
on-chain ensuring transparency, secure access through encryption, and
decentralized storage. Researchers earn revenue directly from paper sales, and
NFT-based achievement badges incentivize active participation and high-quality
contributions.

## Reason for Choosing this Project:

PaperFi addresses critical issues in academic publishing, such as monopolization
by centralized journals that impose high access costs and restrict researchers'
control over their work. As a pharmacist and blockchain enthusiast, I aim to
apply the principles of decentralization to make scientific knowledge more
accessible and empower researchers worldwide.

### Target Audience:

The main target are the researchers and academics by serving them with an
alternative to publishing. Attached to researchers we will have universities,
research institutions, libraries, and independent learners interested in
accessing cutting-edge research. Academics are more prone to be onboarded to a
blockchain like Solana.

## Competitive Landscape

### Competitors:

ResearchHub and traditional academic publishers.

### Differentiators:

- PDA-based on-chain storage for paper metadata (no limitations on sales).
- Secure, one-time-use decryption mechanisms for paper access.
- Peer review functionality with public reviews visible on paper pages.
- No APC (Article Processing Charges).
- Achievement badges as NFTs to incentivize contributions.
- Revenue from direct sales without secondary market dependency.
- Researchers can pay other renowned researchers or freelancers to review
  research
- Teams can hire researchers to do particular research
- Weekly Newsletter with Research/community updates
